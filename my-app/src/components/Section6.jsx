                            I used to struggle with interview preparation. I knew the answers, but saying them confidently was always hard. Hours of random practice felt exhausting, and I kept delaying mock sessions. One week turned into a month — and eventually, I stopped altogether.

                            That’s why I built Arivana AI.
